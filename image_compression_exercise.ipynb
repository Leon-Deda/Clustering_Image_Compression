    "\n",
    "The elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters (k) in K-Means by plotting the inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) against different values of k. The \"elbow\" point, where inertia stops decreasing significantly, suggests the best k for clustering."

    "* In this challenge, we will use the Elbow Method to find the optimal value of k for K-Means clustering. The idea is to plot the distortion (also known as inertia) for a range of values of k and look for the \"elbow\" in the plot. The \"elbow\" corresponds to the point where increasing k no longer significantly improves the clustering, helping us choose the optimal value of k.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply K-Means for different values of k: We'll try different values of k (from 1 to 16) and calculate the distortion for each.\n",
    "Plot the results: You will plot the distortion for each value of k and visually identify the \"elbow.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is Distortion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Distortion measures how well the clustering fits the data. It's calculated as the sum of squared distances between the data points and their assigned cluster centers. Lower distortion indicates better clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to identify the optimal k:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the Distortion: The graph will show distortion on the y-axis and k (number of clusters) on the x-axis.\n",
    "Find the \"Elbow\": The optimal k is typically where the plot first starts to flatten out or where the decrease in distortion slows down significantly.\n",
    "Interpretation: Before the elbow, increasing k significantly reduces distortion. After the elbow, adding more clusters doesn't reduce distortion much, so that's usually the point where you stop increasing k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If the graph shows a sharp drop in distortion from k=1 to k=4 and then flattens out, then k=4 would likely be the optimal number of clusters."
